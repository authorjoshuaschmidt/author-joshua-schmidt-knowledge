His writing invites readers to walk boldly into their brokenness and discover the God who not only sees their pain but sits with them in it. Isaiah 43:2 For Joshua, faith is not a performance or checklist, it’s a raw, honest journey of transformation through grace.His books, including The Tears of God and Better Than Being Right, are deeply rooted in lived experience and spiritual revelation. The Tears of God, though brief in length, delivers a profound message about God’s shared suffering with humanity. In Better Than Being Right: I Was Always Right Until I Found How to Have Relationship, Joshua reflects on one of the most powerful teachings he ever heard, a message by Jack Frost that radically reshaped his understanding of love, humility, and human connection.Joshua’s faith is shaped not just by books or sermons, but by moments that pierced his soul and changed his course. He recalls just three sermons from the thousands he’s heard, each one etched into his memory because of their power, vulnerability, and truth. From a sharply dressed preacher in Titusville, Florida who literally stripped away his clothing revealing holes and shredded stained clothes and tattoos to reveal humility and authenticity, to a pastor in Louisiana who quietly led Muslims to Christ through genuine friendship and cultural respect, Joshua has learned that transformation happens not through force, but through relationship, honesty, and love.For the past thirteen years, Joshua has made his home in Guatemala with Monica the love of his life and greatest teacher and his children. There, he lives out his ministry not in pulpits, but on dirt soccer fields and in the hearts of young people. In a country where many youth face a future of underemployment and early parenthood, Joshua reaches them through what they love most, fútbol (soccer). His outreach includes forming youth teams, distributing uniforms, food, and building long-term relationships rooted in love, self-respect, and faith in Christ. The simple gift of a new jersey. a symbol of dignity and belonging often opens the door for deeper conversations about identity, purpose, and salvation.Joshua is not affiliated with any denomination or church in the United States. He chooses instead to speak online to youth groups, disciple young leaders, and walk the hard paths of ministry without the spotlight. He frequently hosts conversations with visiting missionaries to Guatemala, urging them to move beyond photo ops and toward sustainable evangelism. In a region prone to earthquakes and poverty, he challenges mission teams to focus less on building fragile wood structures and more on lasting solutions. contact joshua Instagram Spotify Linkedin back to top WhatsApp us\n\nSLUG (/?page_id=729) CONTENT:\nSoul Seeds Series &#8211; Author Songwriter Soul Seeds Series &#8211; Author Songwriter Home Books Author Series Soul Seeds Series The Letters of Life Series The Great Exhange Series Soul Spectrum Series Restored: A Redemption and Recovery Series The Kingdom Conquest Series Exuberance: the battle for lasting joy Series Redeeming the Seasons: Series Childrens Book Children of the Word Series About Children of the Word Series Books Series 1-12 Music About Altarstone Worship Sheet Music Social Media Instagram On Amazon LinkedIn YouTube Spotify Cart Home Books Author Series Soul Seeds Series The Letters of Life Series The Great Exhange Series Soul Spectrum Series Restored: A Redemption and Recovery Series The Kingdom Conquest Series Exuberance: the battle for lasting joy Series Redeeming the Seasons: Series Childrens Book Children of the Word Series About Children of the Word Series Books Series 1-12 Music About Altarstone Worship Sheet Music Social Media Instagram On Amazon LinkedIn YouTube Spotify Cart Soul Seeds Collection The Soul Seeds Series is a collection of raw, honest, and spiritually sharp books designed to confront the lies that grow in silence and plant truth where chaos once lived.

On one side stand sin’s false equities — fear, doubt, grief, weariness, despair, and death. On the other stands Christ’s eternal assets — faith, assurance, comfort, strength, hope, and resurrection life. Every thought, every decision, every word fills one of these columns. The cross is not a tool for better management of the ledger — it is the place where Christ cancels the false equity and transfers the believer into eternal worth.Each volume in this six-book series explores one of life’s great exchanges, showing how the lies of sin enslave and how the truth of grace sets free. Rooted in Scripture, each book unfolds the war of the human soul — which thief will you be? The one clinging to fear, pride, guilt, and despair, or the one who surrenders to Christ and receives life, freedom, and hope?More than devotionals, these books are roadmaps for transformation. With clarity and conviction, drawing readers into the tension of the ledger, then points to the victory already secured in Christ. Each book holds a mirror to the restless heart and asks the question that can no longer be ignored: Will you keep investing in sin’s empty securities, or will you exchange them for the assets of eternal life?The Great Exchange is not theory — it is the daily choice of your soul. $1.99 ebook$18.99 paperbacktheme:Gracelesson:God’s grace that breaks every shacklepage count:347Coming Soon Album:Grace has the Final Word\n\nSLUG (/?page_id=1026) CONTENT:\nSoul Spectrum &#8211; Author Songwriter Soul Spectrum &#8211; Author Songwriter Home Books Author Series Soul Seeds Series The Letters of Life Series The Great Exhange Series Soul Spectrum Series Restored: A Redemption and Recovery Series The Kingdom Conquest Series Exuberance: the battle for lasting joy Series Redeeming the Seasons: Series Childrens Book Children of the Word Series About Children of the Word Series Books Series 1-12 Music About Altarstone Worship Sheet Music Social Media Instagram On Amazon LinkedIn YouTube Spotify Cart Home Books Author Series Soul Seeds Series The Letters of Life Series The Great Exhange Series Soul Spectrum Series Restored: A Redemption and Recovery Series The Kingdom Conquest Series Exuberance: the battle for lasting joy Series Redeeming the Seasons: Series Childrens Book Children of the Word Series About Children of the Word Series Books Series 1-12 Music About Altarstone Worship Sheet Music Social Media Instagram On Amazon LinkedIn YouTube Spotify Cart Soul Spectrum Series This multi‑book journey will pull you into faith’s greatest mysteries and lead you into an unexpected story of hope.
